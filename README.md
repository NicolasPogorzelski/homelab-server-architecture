> A layered infrastructure designed with platform engineering principles and a Zero-Trust access model.

## Architecture Overview

The system is built on Proxmox and structured into clear responsibility layers:

### Storage Layer – VM102
- SnapRAID (parity-based protection)
- MergerFS (namespace abstraction)
- SMB3 (segmented least-privilege exports)

### Compute Layer – VM100
- Docker-based workloads
- NVIDIA GPU passthrough
- Read-only media mounts
- LAN-optimized streaming

### Service Layer – Unprivileged LXCs
- Nextcloud
- Vaultwarden
- Calibre-Web
- Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)

## Security Model (Zero Trust)

- No public ingress
- No router port forwarding
- Identity-bound remote access via Tailscale
- No implicit network trust
- Strict least-privilege SMB segmentation
- Unprivileged containers

Remote access path:

Internet → Tailscale → Services

LAN exposure is restricted to media workloads only.

## Storage Architecture

- SnapRAID for parity protection (scheduled sync)
- MergerFS for flexible disk growth
- Heterogeneous ext4 data disks
- Service-specific segmented shares

---

## Operational Model

- Reboot-safe mounts (fstab + systemd)
- Explicit dependency layering
- Documented recovery procedures
- Monitoring independent from application layer

## Core Technologies

Proxmox · Debian · Ubuntu · Docker · SnapRAID · MergerFS · Samba · Prometheus · Grafana · Tailscale

## Design Philosophy

This infrastructure prioritizes:

- Deterministic recovery
- Security through segmentation
- Explicit trust boundaries
- Operational transparency
- Documented trade-offs

The goal is predictable behavior under failure and controlled exposure.
