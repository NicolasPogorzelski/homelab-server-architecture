# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Current Work in Progress

- **Branch:** `feat/ansible-setup`
- **Status:** Ansible Learning Roadmap items #1–#13 done. **Ansible track complete. Next: Terraform track.**
- **Detailed handover** — the completed roles/playbooks catalog and per-session narratives live in [`docs/platform/ansible-progress.md`](docs/platform/ansible-progress.md). Append new session notes there; keep this section short.

- **Ansible Learning Roadmap (in order):**
  1. ~~OS updates playbook~~ ✅
  2. ~~Bootstrap playbook~~ ✅
  3. ~~First role — node_exporter~~ ✅
  4. ~~Jinja2 templates — prometheus-config role~~ ✅
  5. ~~Handlers~~ ✅
  6. ~~Ansible Vault~~ ✅
  7. ~~SSH hardening role — `PasswordAuthentication no`, `PermitRootLogin no`, sshd handler; adopt `--check --diff` as standard dry-run habit from here on~~ ✅
  8. ~~New node onboarding — `ansible/playbooks/onboarding.yml`: 3 plays (bootstrap as root → ssh-hardening → node_exporter); structure complete, real-node test skipped (no available fresh LXC)~~ ✅
  9. ~~Docker update workflow — pull new images, restart compose stacks via Ansible~~ ✅ (2026-06-11, `docker-compose-update` role)
  10. ~~PostgreSQL provisioning role — create DB + user for new services on LXC260 (replaces manual `psql`)~~ ✅ (2026-06-11, `postgresql-provisioning` role)
  11. ~~PostgreSQL backup playbook — `pg_dump` on LXC260, verify output, store locally~~ ✅ (2026-06-12, `postgresql-backup` role)
  12. ~~Fleet health check playbook — query all nodes, output status overview~~ ✅ (2026-06-12, `fleet-health-check.yml`)
  13. ~~CI/CD + ansible-lint (lightweight) — GitHub Actions: `ansible-lint` on push, `--check` against inventory on PR. Keep minimal — no elaborate matrix or multi-stage pipeline.~~ ✅ (2026-06-12, `.github/workflows/ansible-lint.yml`)
  14. ~~Molecule — unit testing for Ansible roles~~ **Deferred** — out of scope for the current learning arc; revisit after the Terraform and Kubernetes tracks.

  **Note:** LXC provisioning (creating containers) is intentionally excluded — that belongs to Terraform, which follows as the next learning track after Ansible.

**Next learning track (after Ansible):** Terraform — primarily on **AWS (free tier)** to learn HCL/state/modules on a widely-used provider, plus a thin **Proxmox slice** for the homelab payoff: `terraform apply` → LXC exists → `onboarding.yml` configures it.

**Roadmap after Terraform:** Kubernetes (k3s) basics, then cloud depth and Python. Bash scripting is cross-cutting throughout. Detailed timeline, certifications, and career milestones live in the private global instructions, not in this repo.

**PR Cadence:** Learning-path branches (`feat/ansible-setup`, `feat/terraform-setup`, etc.) are merged to `main` as a whole when the topic is complete — not after individual items. The items within a topic build on each other and form a single coherent arc. Exception: self-contained platform changes unrelated to the learning topic (e.g. runbooks, hotfixes) are split off to their own branch and PRed independently.

## Working Context (Learning Mode)

This repo is a learning vehicle and portfolio piece for a DevOps career transition.
When working on tasks here:

- Explain every CLI flag and every config value — no copy-paste answers.
- For new tools or configs: link to official documentation first, identify
  relevant sections, then implement.
- Root cause before fix: symptom → verification command → diagnosis → fix.
- Small steps, verify before next step.
- When unsure, say so. Don't hallucinate flags, paths, or behavior.
- Code learning (Bash/Python/YAML): blank-file-first. The first draft is written
  from an empty file without AI or copied snippets — AI is used only to review
  afterwards. The goal is active recall, not recognition; the struggle is the point.

OS context: Proxmox host + Debian 12 LXCs. Daily driver is CachyOS (Arch-based).
Commands must be OS-specific — no generic "Linux commands" when behavior differs.

## Commit Policy

- Never add `Co-Authored-By` or any AI attribution trailer to commit messages.
- Never reference AI tools, Claude, or Anthropic in commit messages or documentation.

## Commit Message Format

Conventional Commits with scope required.

**Format:** `<type>(<scope>): <description>`

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `chore`, `test`, `ci`

**Scopes:**
- Per node: `vm100`, `vm102`, `lxc200`, `lxc210`, `lxc211`, `lxc220`, `lxc230`, `lxc240`, `lxc250`, `lxc260`
- Thematic: `monitoring`, `network`, `docs`, `adr`, `runbook`, `ci`, `repo`, `platform`

**Examples:**
- `feat(lxc260): add PostgreSQL 15 with hardened pg_hba`
- `docs(platform): add tailscale ACL tier0 rules`
- `fix(monitoring): correct grafana datasource url`
- `chore(repo): update validate-repo.sh check 12`

## Validation

Run the repo validation script before committing or opening a PR:

```bash
./scripts/validate-repo.sh
```

This script enforces 12 checks and is also run by CI on every push/PR to `main`. Fix all errors before merging. The checks catch: empty markdown files, broken internal links, committed `.env` files, missing required doc sections, unsanitized Tailscale IPs or tailnet IDs, private keys, missing `.env.example` files, and files outside the allowed directory structure.

## Documentation Audit Rule

Before every commit that touches `docs/` or `ansible/`:

1. Run `./scripts/validate-repo.sh` and fix all errors before staging.
2. Audit all docs touched in this session for content completeness:
   - Required sections present? (`## Access Model`, `## Failure Impact`, `## Configuration Management`)
   - Cross-links to related docs present and correct?
   - Platform Changelog in `docs/platform/changelog.md` updated with today's change?
3. Show audit results to the user before committing — one line per file checked.

This rule applies even if `validate-repo.sh` passes. Structural checks (script) and content checks (this rule) are complementary, not redundant.

## Repository Structure

This is a **documentation and configuration repository** — no application code, no build system, no tests. The content is:

- `docs/` — Architecture, design decisions, node docs, service docs, platform docs
- `docker/` — Docker Compose stacks and `.env.example` files, one directory per service
- `runbooks/` — Operational procedures (must follow the runbook contract)
- `snippets/` — Reference configs and helper scripts (sanitized)
- `scripts/` — Repo tooling (`validate-repo.sh`)
- `ansible/` — Ansible configuration, inventory, playbooks, roles

Only these top-level directories are allowed (enforced by Check 12).

## Documentation Conventions

**Mandatory sections by doc type** (enforced by validation):

| Doc type | Required section |
|---|---|
| `docs/services/*.md` | `## Access Model` (Zero Trust) |
| `docs/nodes/*.md` | `## Failure Impact` |
| `runbooks/**/*.md` (non-README) | `Precondition`, `Verification`, `Failure` |

**Sanitization rules** (enforced by validation):

- Tailscale IPs must use placeholder `<tailscale-ip-nodename>`, never bare `100.x.y.z`
- Tailnet IDs must use placeholder `<tailnet-id>`, never bare `*.ts.net`
- Never commit `.env` files; only `.env.example` files belong in the repo
- Each `docker/` subdirectory with a `docker-compose.yml` must have a `.env.example`

## Architecture

Single-host Proxmox platform. No HA — recovery-oriented design.

**Compute layer:** VM100 (Docker, GPU/NVIDIA) runs media services (Jellyfin, Audiobookshelf) and inference backends (Ollama).

**Storage layer:** VM102 (MergerFS + SnapRAID + Samba). Services access storage over SMB via Tailscale, not LAN.

**Service LXCs** (all Docker-in-LXC unless noted):
- LXC200 – Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)
- LXC210 – Nextcloud (native stack: Apache + PHP + MariaDB + Redis)
- LXC211 – Paperless-ngx
- LXC220 – Calibre-Web
- LXC230 – OpenWebUI (AI stack entrypoint)
- LXC240 – Vaultwarden (secrets tier)
- LXC250 – DevOps workstation (Git, Ansible, IaC — no user-facing services)
- LXC260 – PostgreSQL (centralized platform database; all services that need a DB use this)

**Access model:** Zero Trust via Tailscale. No public ingress, no port-forwarding, LAN is untrusted. Nodes are grouped into tags (`tag:tier0`, `tag:tier1`, `tag:tier2`, `tag:monitoring`, `tag:database`, `tag:ai-stack`, etc.) with explicit ACL rules. The ACL policy lives in the Tailscale admin console; `docs/platform/tailscale-acl.md` mirrors the intended model.

**Binding rule:** Services bind to the Tailscale IP directly, or to loopback and proxied via `tailscale serve`. Never to LAN interfaces.

## Known Technical Debt & Gotchas

Do not flag these as new issues — they are documented tradeoffs or known quirks:

- **LXC220 (Calibre-Web):** UID mapping requires `chown 100000:100000` on mounted storage.
- **LXC240 (Vaultwarden):** SQLite on CIFS is a known limitation, documented as tech debt.
- **Grafana admin password:** only read on first container start. Reset via
  `grafana-cli admin reset-admin-password`.
- **Tailscale Serve HTTPS/HTTP mismatch:** fix with `tailscale serve off` + reconfigure.
- **`network_mode: host` + Docker:** no Docker DNS resolution, use `127.0.0.1`
  instead of container names.
- **VM100 Jellyfin CUDA:** requires `pid: "host"` in docker-compose for
  NVIDIA Container Toolkit access.
- **Service-level monitoring (KE-8 gap — REMEDIATED 2026-06-08):** previously
  alerting covered only `NodeDown` (node_exporter) + disk, not service ports.
  Now `blackbox_exporter` on lxc200 probes 7 services (HTTP + Serve-HTTPS) with a
  `ServiceDown` rule; Tailscale ACL Rule 1c grants monitoring the service ports.
  First run already caught paperless + openwebui returning 502 (dead backends).
- **journald not persisting logs on vm100/vm102 (gap, fix planned):** despite
  `/var/log/journal`, recent boots' logs were lost (see KE-8); forensics fell
  back to wtmp / apt-dpkg text logs / Docker JSON / Prometheus. Remediation:
  investigate `Storage=` / `SystemMaxUse`.
- **unattended-upgrades active on vm100 (uncontrolled change):** installs
  packages incl. kernels autonomously, outside the Ansible `apt-upgrade.yml`
  workflow — on a GPU node this risks kernel/NVIDIA-DKMS coupling after the next
  reboot. Decision pending: disable, or restrict to security-only + exclude kernels.
- **MergerFS pool ~96% full on vm102 (by design):** the media archive is meant
  to fill; read-only consumers (Jellyfin/ABS/Calibre) are unaffected, but write
  consumers (Nextcloud/Paperless/Vaultwarden/Postgres-backups) will eventually
  hit `ENOSPC` — capacity expansion is the lever, not deletion. The `<15% free`
  disk alert on archive disks is largely non-actionable (alert tiering by role pending).

## Platform Changelog

The full platform changelog lives in [`docs/platform/changelog.md`](docs/platform/changelog.md) (reverse chronological), kept out of this file so the always-loaded instruction context stays small. Detailed ACL changes are in `docs/platform/tailscale-acl.md#changelog`. **When recording a new platform change, append it there, not here.**

## Adding a New Service

1. Before implementation: link official upstream docs, identify relevant sections, wait for confirmation
2. Create `docs/services/<service>.md` with an `## Access Model` section referencing `docs/platform/tailscale-acl.md`
3. Create `docs/nodes/<node>.md` with a `## Failure Impact` section
4. Add the node's Tailscale tag to `docs/platform/tailscale-acl.md` (tier model, tag ownership, ACL rules, access matrix, changelog)
5. If Docker-based: add `docker/<service>/docker-compose.yml` and `docker/<service>/.env.example`; use pinned version tags (not `:latest`)
6. Run `./scripts/validate-repo.sh` and fix all errors
